we chose to work on the third project which was about the game and our plan was to make a maze game using html,css and javascript.
 we had no idea how to start but we worked all night to make this work the way we wanted it to.
 our goal was to make a intense maze game where the aim is to get to the end of the maze before youre out of moves or time.
 we decied to get all the requirements expected from the 1 ,2 and 3rd year students but we soon learned that it was too ambisous. 
the requirements that we managed to do correctly was having a win&lose state. we made an object that can navigate through the map freely.
 we have an active point system and thats shown by how many actions you have left until you get the lose state. 
we dont have a highscore system but we have the scrore fuction that tells you what your score was after each match.
there was two things that we had planned on doing but couldn't do, one was that we had an idea to have this camera-like box/frame that would be 300x300.
 we had planned to make the map move the opposite direction to what the object was doing so it could give this feeling of a world
 and to make it so the player doesnt get to see more than 150px to the front of the map to make it feel more like a maze.
but the biggest fail was that we couldnt make the walls of the maze solid so the object can just go through them which defeats the purpose of the game. 
we tried researching color dections methods, how to get data from images and Collision detection but we couldnt make it work.
     
we used "http://www.mazegenerator.net/" to generate a maze so we could use it on our game.
